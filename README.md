# Data Quality Anomaly Lab

## Overview
The Data Quality Anomaly Lab is a Python-based testing environment designed to simulate various data quality issues. This project aims to provide developers and data scientists with a tool to test and evaluate the robustness of their data cleaning and processing solutions against a wide range of data quality anomalies.

## Features
- **Anomaly Simulation**: Mock various data quality issues like missing values, duplicates, outliers, format inconsistencies, and erroneous entries.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Easy configuration to simulate specific data quality challenges tailored to different use cases.
- **Extensive Dataset Support**: Test against diverse datasets including structured data (CSV, SQL), semi-structured (JSON, XML), and unstructured data.
- **Metrics and Reporting**: Evaluate the effectiveness of data cleaning solutions with built-in metrics and reporting tools.
